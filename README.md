# About
An invisible ink drawing app written in JavaScript using HTML canvas. 

# Controls
Use your mouse or finger (on touch devices) to draw whatever you want, and it will start to fade andeventually disappear over time.

The left button (circular arrow) erases everything on the canvas, the middle button (eye icon) "reveals" what you drew, and the right button allows you to pick colors.
